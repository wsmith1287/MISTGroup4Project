Problem Description:
The problem that we are trying to solve has to do with the creation of a working database that consolidates data for a soccer club into a functioning model. The main entity that comprises this data and the model is the Team entity which is made up of the different teams that comprise the soccer club and includes information such as their team name and where their home field is. In addition to this, we have other entities such as data on the players that comprise these teams, the statistics for each of these players, the coaching staff that make up the soccer club, and much more. In addition to a working model, we hope to build many working queries that provide data to possible stakeholders of the soccer club to make well informed complex decisions regarding the clubs activities. With this complex data model and the many different queries we hope to deliver working data that can be used by the soccer club to operate at an increased efficiency level and deliver better value to its stakeholders.
